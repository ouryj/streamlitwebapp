# streamlitwebapp
webapp demo
The web app is a data analysis dashboard built using Streamlit, Plotly Express, and Pandas. It allows users to explore and visualize a dataset of car advertisements in the U.S., focusing on aspects like price, mileage, condition, and year of manufacture. The dataset, "vehicles_us.csv," contains information on various used vehicles listed for sale, including details about the make, model, price, and technical specifications. Users can interact with the app through customizable visualizations, such as histograms and scatter plots, to uncover trends and patterns in the used car market. This helps provide insights into factors like pricing strategy, mileage trends, and market availability across different regions.
